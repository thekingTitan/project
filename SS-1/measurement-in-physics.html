        <h2>Conversion from One Unit to Another</h2>
        <h3>General Steps for Unit Conversion</h3>
        <ol>
            <h3><li>Identify the Units:</li></h3>
            <p>Determine the unit you are converting from and the unit you are converting to.</p>
            <h3><li>Find the Conversion Factor:</li></h3>
            <p>Look up the conversion factor between the two units. A conversion factor is a ratio that expresses how many of one unit are equal to another unit.</p>
            <h3><li>Set Up the Conversion:</li></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Write down the quantity you want to convert.</li>
                <li>Multiply the quantity by the conversion factor.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><li>Cancel Units:</li></h3>
            <p>Ensure that the units cancel appropriately, leaving you with the desired unit.</p>
            <h3><li>Calculate the Result:</li></h3>
            <p>Perform the multiplication to get the final converted value.</p>
        </ol>
        <h2>Conversion Factor:</h2>
        <p>Conversion factor is a numerical value used to convert a measurement from one unit to another. It represents the ratio of the two
           units and is used to transform the value of a physical quantity from one unit to another.
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>To convert meters (m) to kilometers (km), the conversion factor is 1 km = 1000 m, so the conversion factor is;<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1000</sub> .</li>
            <li>To convert seconds (s) to minutes (min), the conversion factor is 1 min = 60 s, so the conversion factor is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>60</sub> .</li> 
        </ul>    
        <h3>Conversion factors are used to:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Change units from one system to another (e.g., from SI to imperial units)</li>
            <li>Convert between different units of the same physical quantity (e.g., from meters to kilometers)</li>
            <li>Simplify calculations by converting units to more convenient or familiar forms
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>Conversion factors are often dimensionless quantities, but they can also have dimensions, depending on the specific conversion. 
           They are essential in physics and engineering to ensure accurate and consistent calculations, and to facilitate communication 
           and comparison of measurements across different systems and units.</p>

            <div class="facts">
            <span class="marked"><h3>Fun Fact!</h3>
            <p>You may be wondering when are you expected to multiply or divide on the conversion .</p>
            <p>“In conversion factors, we are essentially multiplying by a special kind of fraction called a "conversion fraction".</p>
                
            <p>When we multiply by a conversion fraction, we are essentially scaling the original value by a certain amount.</p>
                
            <p>The reason we sometimes divide and sometimes multiply is because of the way the conversion fractions are set up.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When the conversion fraction has a value greater than 1 (like 1000 mm/m), we multiply to scale up the value.</li>
                <li>When the conversion fraction has a value less than 1 (like 0.01 m/cm), we divide to scale down the value.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Think of it like this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiplying by a large value (greater than 1) stretches the value, like zooming in on a map.</li>
                <li>Dividing by a small value (less than 1) shrinks the value, like zooming out on a map.</li>
            
            </ul>
            <p>By multiplying or dividing by the appropriate conversion fraction, we can change the units of 
               our value without changing its physical meaning. This allows us to convert between different units of measurement!”</p></span>

            <h3>Using Dimensional Analysis</h3> 
            <p>Dimensional analysis is a powerful technique in physics to ensure that the units are consistent
              and correct. This method involves treating units algebraically and ensuring they cancel out properly during calculations.</p>
            <h3>Example:</h3>

                <p>To: Meters per second (<sup>m</sup>&frasl;<sub>s</sub>)</p>
                <h3><li>Find the Conversion Factors:</li></h3>  
                <p>1 kilometer = 1000 meters</p> 
                <p>1 hour = 3600 seconds</p>
                <h3><li>Set Up the Conversion:</li></h3>
                <p>Suppose you have a speed of 90 km/h.</p>
                <h3><li>Multiply and Cancel Units:</li></h3>
                <p><sup>90km</sup>&frasl;<sub>h</sub> × <sup>1000meters</sup>&frasl;<sub>1km</sub> × <sup>1hour</sup>&frasl;<sub>3600seconds</sub></p>
                
                <p>= 90 × <sup>1000</sup>&frasl;<sub>3600m/s</sub></p>
                
                <h3>Simplify:</h3>
                <p>90 × <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>18m/s</sub></p>
        
                <p>= 25m/s</p>

                    <!--<h2>What are Fundamental Quantities? </h2>-->
                    <p>Fundamental physical quantities serve as the foundational measurable quantities in physics, from which all other quantities 
                       can be derived. These independent quantities form the basis of the SI (International System of Units) measurement system. 
                       In the SI system, there are seven fundamental physical quantities:</p></div>
                        <li>Length (meter, m): The distance between two points in space.</li>
                        <li> Mass (kilogram, kg): The amount of matter in an object.</li>
                        <li>Time (second, s): The duration of an event.</li>
                        <li>Electric current (ampere, A): The flow of electric charge.</li>
                        <li>Thermodynamic temperature (Kelvin, K): The measure of the thermal energy of a system.</li>
                        <li>Amount of substance (mole, mol): The number of entities (such as atoms, molecules) in a sample. </li>
                        <li>Luminous intensity (candela, cd): The measure of the perceived power of light.</li>
                       </ol>
                    <p>These fundamental quantities are utilized to define derived quantities, which are expressed as algebraic combinations of
                        the fundamental quantities. For example, velocity is a derived quantity expressed as length divided by time (m/s).</p>

        <h2>Dimension Analysis</h2>
        <p>Dimensional analysis serves as a fundamental tool in the fields of physics and engineering, allowing for a comprehensive understanding and 
            prediction of the behavior of physical systems. It encompasses the examination of relationships between different physical quantities through
            the consideration of their dimensions and units.

        <p>Key components of dimensional analysis include dimensional homogeneity, dimensional and dimensionless variables, and the steps required to 
            apply dimensional analysis. This method proves valuable in ensuring the consistency of equations involving physical quantities, establishing 
            new relationships between physical quantities, converting units, and analyzing the behavior of physical systems.</p>
            
        <p>Noteworthy concepts in dimensional analysis include dimensionless groups and the Buckingham π theorem, both of which 
            aid in simplifying physical equations and identifying dimensionless relationships between variables.</p>
        <p>The applications of dimensional analysis encompass a range of scenarios, such as the analysis of falling object motion under gravity, the study of fluid behavior, and the comprehension of thermal expansion in materials due to temperature changes.</p>
