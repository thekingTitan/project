            <h3>Definition of Measurement</h3>
            <p>Measurement is the process of assigning a numerical value to a physical quantity, such as length, mass, or time, to describe its magnitude or amount.
                Measurements are essential in physics because they allow us to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Describe phenomena accurately</li>
                <li>Test hypotheses and theories</li>

        </ol>
        <h3>Conversion from One Unit to Another</h3>
        <h4>Conversion Factor:</h4>
        <p>Conversion factor is a numerical value used to convert a measurement from one unit to another. It represents the ratio of the two
           units and is used to transform the value of a physical quantity from one unit to another.
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>To convert meters (m) to kilometers (km), the conversion factor is 1 km = 1000 m, so the conversion factor is;<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1000</sub> .</li>
            <li>To convert seconds (s) to minutes (min), the conversion factor is 1 min = 60 s, so the conversion factor is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>60</sub> .</li> 
        </ul>    
        <h4>Conversion factors are used to:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Change units from one system to another (e.g., from SI to imperial units)</li>
            <li>Convert between different units of the same physical quantity (e.g., from meters to kilometers)</li>
            <li>Simplify calculations by converting units to more convenient or familiar forms
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>Conversion factors are often dimensionless quantities, but they can also have dimensions, depending on the specific conversion. 
           They are essential in physics and engineering to ensure accurate and consistent calculations, and to facilitate communication 
           and comparison of measurements across different systems and units.</p>
        <h3>Common Conversion factors used in Physics:</h3>
        <p>These are conversion factors you should know because they are commonly use in physics contexts.
            Don't worry if you can't memorize this now, we will refer to it till the end of the course.</p>
