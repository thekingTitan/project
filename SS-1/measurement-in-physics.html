            <h3>Definition of Measurement</h3>
            <p>Measurement is the process of assigning a numerical value to a physical quantity, such as length, mass, or time, to describe its magnitude or amount.
                Measurements are essential in physics because they allow us to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Describe phenomena accurately</li>
                <li>Test hypotheses and theories</li>
                <li> Predict outcomes</li>
                <li>Compare results</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Ways measurement is done in physics</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Conversion: Convert between different units of measurement, such as length (m to cm or inches to feet).</li>

            <li> Scaling: Scale up or down between different sizes of units, like enlarging or reducing a diagram.</li>
                
            <li>Calculation: Perform arithmetic operations (+, -, x, /) with measurements, like finding the total length of several objects.</li>
                
            <li>Comparison: Compare measurements to determine which is larger or smaller.</li>
                
            <li>Estimation: Estimate a measurement based on a known reference point or approximation.</li>
                
            <li>Rounding: Round measurements to the nearest whole number or decimal place.</li>
                
            <li>Unit cancellation: Cancel out units when performing calculations, like converting meters to centimeters (m → cm).</li>
                
            <li>Dimensional analysis: Use units to guide calculations and ensure correct answers.</li>
                
            <li>Proportionality: Use ratios and proportions to solve measurement problems, like finding the scale factor of a map.</li>
                
            <li>Measurement formulas: Apply formulas specific to measurement, such as the formula for the area of a rectangle (A = L × W).</li>
                
        </ol>
        <h3>Conversion from One Unit to Another</h3>
        <h4>Conversion Factor:</h4>
        <p>Conversion factor is a numerical value used to convert a measurement from one unit to another. It represents the ratio of the two
           units and is used to transform the value of a physical quantity from one unit to another.
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>To convert meters (m) to kilometers (km), the conversion factor is 1 km = 1000 m, so the conversion factor is;<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1000</sub> .</li>
            <li>To convert seconds (s) to minutes (min), the conversion factor is 1 min = 60 s, so the conversion factor is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>60</sub> .</li> 
        </ul>    
        <h4>Conversion factors are used to:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Change units from one system to another (e.g., from SI to imperial units)</li>
            <li>Convert between different units of the same physical quantity (e.g., from meters to kilometers)</li>
            <li>Simplify calculations by converting units to more convenient or familiar forms
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>Conversion factors are often dimensionless quantities, but they can also have dimensions, depending on the specific conversion. 
           They are essential in physics and engineering to ensure accurate and consistent calculations, and to facilitate communication 
           and comparison of measurements across different systems and units.</p>
        <h3>Common Conversion factors used in Physics:</h3>
        <p>These are conversion factors you should know because they are commonly use in physics contexts.
            Don't worry if you can't memorize this now, we will refer to it till the end of the course.</p>
