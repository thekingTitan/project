        <h1>Motion in one dimension </h1>
        
        <p>Motion in one dimension, also known as linear motion, is the simplest 
           form of motion. It occurs when an object moves along a straight line.
           The key concepts and quantities related to one-dimensional motion include:</p>
        <ol>
            <h3><li>Displacement (S):</li></h3>
                <p>Displacement is a vector quantity that refers to the change in position 
                   of an object. It is defined as the final position minus the initial position.</p>
                <h4>Formula:</h4>
                <p>S = X<sub>f</sub> ‚Äì X<sub>i</sub></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Initial Position (X<sub>i</sub>) : The starting point of the object.</li>
                    <li>Final Position (X<sub>f</sub>): The ending point of the object.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3><li>Velocity(v)</li></h3>
                <p>Velocity is the rate of change of an object's position with respect to time. It is a measure of an object's speed in a specific direction.</p>
        
                <p>Here are some key points to know about velocity:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Velocity is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude (amount of movement) and direction.</li>
                    <li>It is measured in units of distance per unit time, such as meters per second (m/s).</li>
                    <li>Velocity can be calculated using the formula: <span class = "marked"><sup>displacement</sup> &frasl;<sub>time</sub></span></li>
                    <li>Velocity can be positive (moving in the direction of motion) or negative (moving in the opposite direction of motion).</li>
                    <li>Velocity can change over time due to factors such as acceleration or deceleration.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Average Velocity: The total displacement divided by the total time taken.</li>
                    <h4>Formula:</h4>
                    <span class="marked"><p>v avg  =  <sup>s</sup> &frasl;<sub>t</sub></p></span>
                    <li>Instantaneous Velocity: The velocity of an object at a specific moment in time. 
                        It is the derivative of displacement with respect to time.</li>
                    <h4>Formula:</h4>
                    <span class="marked "><p>V = <sup>Œîs</sup>&frasl; <sub>Œît</sub></p></span>
                </ul>

                </ui>
                </ul>

                <h2>Types of motion</h2>
                
                <p>Motion can be classified into several types based on various factors such as the path of the motion, the nature 
                   of the forces involved, and the reference frame. Here are the primary types of motion:</p></div>
                <ol>
                    <h3><li>Linear Motion</li></h3>
                    <p>Linear motion occurs when an object moves along a straight line. It is the simplest type of motion and can be further classified into:</p>

                    <p>Uniform Linear Motion: The object moves with constant speed in a straight line.</p>
                    <p>Non-uniform Linear Motion: The object's speed changes as it moves along a straight line.</p>

                    <h3><li>Circular Motion</li></h3>
                    <p>Circular motion occurs when an object moves along a circular path. It can be further divided into:</p>

                    <p>Uniform Circular Motion: The object moves with a constant speed along a circular path.</p>
                    <p>Non-uniform Circular Motion: The object's speed varies as it moves along a circular path.</p> 

                    <h3><li>Rotational Motion</li></h3>
                    <p>Rotational motion occurs when an object rotates around a fixed axis.
                       Examples include the rotation of the Earth around its axis and the spinning of a wheel.</p>
                    <h3><li>Oscillatory Motion</li></h3>
                    <p>Oscillatory motion occurs when an object moves back and forth around a central point or equilibrium position. Examples include:</p>

                    <p>Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM): A type of oscillatory motion where the restoring force is directly 
                        proportional to the displacement (e.g., a mass on a spring, a pendulum).</p>
                    <p>Damped Oscillatory Motion: Oscillatory motion where the amplitude decreases over time due to dissipative forces like friction or air resistance.</p>
                    <p>Forced Oscillatory Motion: Oscillatory motion where an external periodic force drives the system.</p>
                    <h3><li>Projectile Motion</li></h3>
                    <p>Projectile motion occurs when an object is projected into the air and moves under the influence of gravity. 
                        The path followed by the object is called its trajectory, which is typically parabolic.</p>
                    <h3><li>Random Motion</li></h3>
                    <p>Random motion occurs when an object moves in an unpredictable manner, with no definite path. 
                        Examples include the motion of gas molecules and Brownian motion.</p>
                    <h3><li> Translational Motion</li></h3>
                    <p>Translational motion occurs when an object moves in such a way that all its parts move the same distance in a given time. It can be:</p>
                    <p>Rectilinear Translational Motion: The object moves along a straight line.</p>
                    <p>Curvilinear Translational Motion: The object moves along a curved path.</p>
                    <h3><li>Relative Motion</li></h3>
                    <p>Relative motion refers to the movement of an object as observed from a particular reference frame. The description of the motion can vary depending on the chosen reference frame.</p>
