        <h1>Work, Energy and Power</h1>
        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>Work can be defined as the product of the force applied to an 
        object and the displacement of that object in the direction of the force. 
        This means that when you apply a  force on an object like kicking a ball 
        or pushing a table, this causes the object to move, in that case, we say work is done on the object.
        <p>One thing to note is that just as the force is important for work to be 
        done is also the motion. To better understand this, consider pushing a box across the floor. 
        If you apply a horizontal force and the box moves in the same direction 
        as the force, work is done. If the box does not move, no work is done, regardless of how much force you apply.</p>
        <p>SI unit of work is the Joule (J). Joule can be defined as the amount of work done when a force of one Newton 
        displaces an object by one meter in the direction of the force  i.e. (1 J = 1 N·m).</p>
        <h3>Mathematical Expression:</h3>
        <p>The formula for calculating work (W) is:</p>
        <span class="marked"><p>W = F × d × cos θ</p></span>
        <p>Or simply <span class = "marked">W = F × d </p>
        </span>
        <p>When there is no angle involve that is θ = 0</p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <p>W =  is the work done,</p>
        <p>F = is the magnitude of the force,</p>
        <p>d =  is the displacement of the object,</p>
        <p>Θ = is the angle between the force and the displacement vector.</p>
        
        <h2>Energy</h2>
        <p>Energy is the ability to do work. It is a scalar quantity that can be transferred from 
        one object to another or transformed from one form to another but cannot be created or destroyed.
        Consider a roller coaster at the top of a hill. It has maximum potential energy due to 
        its height. As it descends, potential energy converts to kinetic energy. At the 
        bottom, the roller coaster has maximum kinetic energy and minimal potential energy.</p>
        <p>The SI unit of energy is the Joule (J),  which is the same as work.</p>
        <h3>Types of Energy:</h3>
        <p>There are various types of energy, which will be discussed later. 
            For now, we will talk about the kinetic energy and potential energy.</p>
        <h4>Kinetic Energy (KE):</h4>
        <p>This is the energy a body possessed due to its motion. It is given by the formula:</p>
        <span class="marked"><p>KE = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>mv<sup>2</sup></p></span>
        <p>Where</p>
        <p>m = is the mass of the object and</p>
        <p>v = is its velocity.</p>
        <h4>Potential Energy (PE):</h4>
        <p>The energy possessed by an object due to its position or state. Gravitational potential energy is a common type, calculated by:</p> 
        <p>PE = mgh</p>
        <p>Where </p>
        <p>m = is the mass,</p>
        <p>g = is the acceleration due to gravity and it’s a constant valure which is (9.8m/s^2),</p>
        <p>h = is the height above a reference point.</p>
        <h2>Conversion of Energy</h2>
        <h3>Introduction to Energy Conversion</h3>
        <p> Energy conversion is the process of changing energy from one form to another. This is a fundamental concept in physics and engineering 
        because it explains how energy is utilized in various processes and systems. Energy conversion plays a crucial role in everything from 
        natural phenomena to modern technology.</p>
        <h3>Forms of Energy</h3>
        <p>Energy exists in various forms, each with unique characteristics. Some common forms include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Kinetic Energy (KE):Energy of motion.</li>
            <li>Potential Energy (PE): Energy stored due to position or configuration.</li>
            <li>Thermal Energy: Energy related to the temperature of an object.</li>
            <li>Chemical Energy: Energy stored in chemical bonds.</li>
            <li>Electrical Energy: Energy associated with electric charges and their movement.</li>
            <li>Radiant Energy: Energy carried by electromagnetic waves.</li>
            <li>Nuclear Energy: Energy stored in the nucleus of an atom.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Energy Conversion Processes</h2>
        <p>Energy can be converted from one form to another through various processes. Here are some examples:</p>
        <ol>
            <h4><li>Mechanical to Thermal Energy:</li></h4>
            <p>Example: Friction between moving parts converts mechanical energy into thermal energy. When you rub your hands together, 
                the mechanical energy of the motion is converted into heat, warming your hands.</p>
            <h4><li>Chemical to Electrical Energy:</li></h4>
            <p>Example: In a battery, chemical reactions between the electrolyte and electrodes convert chemical energy into electrical 
                energy, which can power electronic devices.</p>
            <h4><li>Electrical to Mechanical Energy:</li></h4>
            <p>Example:An electric motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. This is how fans, pumps, and many household appliances work.</p>
            <h4><li>Radiant to Chemical Energy:</li></h4>
            <p>Example: Photosynthesis in plants converts radiant energy from the sun into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules.</p>
            <h4><li>Nuclear to Thermal Energy:</li></h4>
            <p>Example: In a nuclear reactor, nuclear fission reactions convert nuclear energy into thermal energy, which can then be used to produce electricity.</p>
            <h4><li>Thermal to Mechanical Energy:</li></h4>
            <p>Example: In a steam engine, thermal energy from boiling water is converted into mechanical energy to move pistons.</p>

        </ol>
        <h3>Conservation of Energy</h3>
        <p>This state that Energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transferred or transformed from one form to another. The total 
        energy of an isolated system remains constant. In a pendulum, energy continuously transforms between kinetic and potential
        forms. At the highest point, potential energy is maximum and kinetic energy is zero. At the lowest point, kinetic energy is 
        maximum and potential energy is zero. The total mechanical energy remains constant if air resistance is negligible.</p>
        <h3>Mathematical Expression:</h3>
        <span class="marked"><p>KE <sub>Initial</sub> + PE <sub>Initial</sub>= KE <sub>final</sub> + PE <sub>final</sub></p>
        </span>
        <h2>Power</h2>
        <p>Power is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. It quantifies how quickly work can be performed. 
        Think of two workers lifting identical boxes to the same height. If one worker takes less time than the other, 
        the worker who takes less time has higher power output, as they accomplish the same amount of work in a shorter time.</p>
        <p>The SI unit of power is the Watt (W), where one Watt is equal to one Joule per second (1 W = 1 J/s).</p>
        <h3>Mathematical Expression:</h3>
        <p>The formula for power (P) is:</p>
        <span class="marked"><p> P = <sup>W</sup>&frasl;<sub>t</sub></p></span>
        <p>where:</p>
        <p>P  = is power,</p>
        <p>W = is the work done,</p>
        <p> t = is the time taken to do the work.</p>

        <h2>Work-Energy Principle</h2>
        <p>Work-Energy principle states that The work done on an object by the net force is equal to the change in the object's kinetic energy. When you apply brakes to a moving car, the work done by the friction force reduces the car's kinetic energy, eventually bringing it to a stop.</p>
        <h3>Mathematical Expression:</h3>
        <span class="marked"><p>W = Δ KE = KE <sub>final</sub> - KE <sub>initial</sub></p></span>
